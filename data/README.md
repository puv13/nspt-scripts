# Example Data 
In this folder we collect original data from NSPT simulations. 

## Principal Chiral Model 
The subfolder *PCM* holds the data used for the publication
[arXiv:1906.0947](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.09471v1).

The complete raw data is provided in the archive file
*PCM_data_all.tgz*. The archive file *PCM_data_unitary.tgz* contains
only the subset of the data without large unitarity violations. See the
paper linked above for more details.

The script *PCM_analysis.sh* in the sub-folder *Example* shows how to
analyse the data using the Python scripts from this repository.
